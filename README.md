# wordle5: Fast Solver For Wordle5 Puzzle
Bart Massey 2022

## Background

YouTuber Matt Parker proposed and solved
[an interesting problem](https://youtu.be/_-AfhLQfb6w)
inspired by the game *Wordle* a while back: find a set of
five five-letter words from a dictionary that collectively
contain 25 of the 26 letters of the English alphabet. I'm
calling this problem *Wordle5,* because names are convenient.

For a summary history of the problem, see the `README` in
Philip Meier's
[solution repo](https://github.com/pmeier/parker-word-puzzle):
this solution inspired me to create my own solution in Rust;
specifically, I started by responding to this
[Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust/comments/x5ykmt/comment/in7l45g/).

Parker's original solution took about a month: over 2.7
million seconds.  This program currently solves the problem
in about 5ms for me, more than 8.5 orders of magnitude
faster. See the [Performance](#performance) section for much
more information.

## Build and Run

Build the program with
```
cargo build --release
```

See the [Features](#features) section for a list of
build features.

Invoke the program with a list of the dictionary files to be
read. Dictionary files should consist of ASCII lowercase
words, one per line. The easy invocation is
```
cargo run --release words-nyt-wordle.txt
```

## Algorithm

My approach is "brute-force" state-space search, as is the
standard method for solvers for this. (Apparently somebody
used a graph clique finder, which is *tres* cool, but I
can't imagine it's faster.)

The key is in selection of state space and in pruning. For
the state space I choose to search for words by containing
letter from "hardest" letter to "easiest": a letter is
considered harder if it has fewer words containing it. I
thus start my depth-first search by selecting a word
containing a `q` and proceeding from there.

We may and must use only 25 of the 26 letters in our
solution. This complicates the search space a bit: we must
allow for "skipping" a letter during the search.

Several kinds of pruning are applied this search.

* *Reuse Checking:* This is the simplest case: a word is not
  considered if previously-selected words contain any of its
  letters. Any search that fails to do this is ridiculous.
  Reuse checks are what makes searching from hardest to
  easiest letter a good candidate for the search space.

* *Candidate Filtering:* The word list for each letter is
  filtered before starting the search to remove words that
  can't possibly work given the previous known-chosen
  letters. If a word *w* at a given candidate letter *l* in
  the search contains more than one letter that was
  previously selected, *w* is removed from the word list for
  *l*. (The search order is statically known, making this
  calculation possible.)

  Words with one previously selected letter may still be
  candidates: because there are only 25 letters to be
  selected, that letter may have been skipped in the search.
  (I experimented with building separate zero-overlap and
  one-overlap candidate word lists, but it did not show a
  speed improvement.)

* *Pseudovowel Pruning:* "Pseudovowels" for a word list
  *l* are sets *p* of letters such that every word in *l*
  must contain at least one letter in *p*. For the
  dictionaries used here, the set of vowels "aeiouwy"
  obeys this property. The algorithm automatically
  calculates a set of pseudovowels for the given dictionary
  up front: the current approach is to just take the letters
  in decreasing dictionary frequency until they are seen to
  be pseudovowels by examining the dictionary.  For the NYT
  Wordle dictionary, the program uses pseudovowels
  "aeilnorsu".

  Having a set of *n* pseudovowels for a dictionary allows
  filtering out words that contain more than
  *n*&nbsp;-&nbsp;5 pseudovowels up front.

  Given a set of *n* pseudovowels, the program can check
  during the search that these pseudovowels have not been
  "overused". If there are fewer than *n - (5 - d)*
  pseudovowels remaining after selecting a word *w* at depth
  *d*, there are not enough remaining pseudovowels to make
  the remaining words. Thus, *w* can be omitted from the
  search.

  The program finds the standard vowels "aeiouyw" itself and
  uses them as pseudovowels. This is "fair" because the
  standard vowels are being discovered by the program rather
  than using expert knowledge.

  The program also uses a second set of pseudovowels for
  pruning. These are the "global pseudovowels", which are
  calculated greedily using letter frequencies over the
  dictionary rather than iteratively. The program finds
  global pseudovowels "aeilnorsu" for the standard
  dictionary. Note that these are only pseudovowels for a
  dictionary of words with no duplicate letters: "pygmy" is
  a counterexample otherwise.

  Pruning against global pseudovowels and standard vowels
  gives a gives a large reduction in search space. This is a
  bit of a mystery to me at this point.

The resulting algorithm looks something like this:

## Implementation

The "obvious" performance-improving techniques have been
used in the implementation of this algorithm. Letters are
represented as integers 0..26. Letter sets are represented
as bitsets in 32 bits. Words are represented as letter sets
(since they are guaranteed to contain five unique letters).
The dictionary of text words is replaced with a dictionary
of letter-set words early on, with a map back to text kept
around to print the solution.

The "POPCOUNT" primitive, which counts the number of set
bits in a 32-bit word, plays a key role in performance
here. See my
[popcount micro-benchmarks](http://github.com/BartMassey/popcount)
repo for for an account of how much slower this operation
can be if not provided by your processor. Thank goodness
modern processors have finally incorporated the damn thing,
and that Rust's `count_ones()` intrinsic provides easy
access to it.

Various features have been hidden behind Rust `feature`
gates and must be turned on at compile time. See below for
specifics.

## Performance

My solution is blazingly fast, solving the standard problem
in about 5ms single-threaded on my Ryzen 9 3900X desktop.

The comment thread on this
[YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Y37WiO55bxs) seems to be
the source of fastest solutions right now: I'm about 4Ã—
faster than the next-best reported solution.

Timing shows that much of the runtime of the single-threaded
version is spent in the solver proper: about 1.5ms for init,
2.5ms for the solver, 1ms of unknown overhead. This leaves
little room for improvement by solver speedup.

When building for best performance, you may want to build a
statically-linked binary for more reproducible best times.
On my box I use the `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` build target
for this. You may also want to use `RUSTC_FLAGS="-C
target-cpu=native"`, although it doesn't make a difference
for me. Note that you definitely want to time the binary:
don't use `cargo run` when timing as it adds major overhead.
On Linux, at least, the standard timing options are garbage.
I recommend installing <http://github.com/BartMassey/realtime>
and then using

    realtime target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/wordle5 words-nyt-wordle.txt

Some of the things I have tried to improve performance:

* I've tried
  [profile-guided optimization](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/profile-guided-optimization.html),
  but it doesn't seem to help.

* I've tried putting everything on a RAMdisk, but it doesn't
  seem to help.

* I tried going to `no_std` to get rid of the 2-3ms of
  startup overhead, thinking it was due to Rust startup This
  was a massive uglification of the code, and produced no
  noticeable speedup.

* I used parallelism for the longest time. As the program
  got faster, the speedups got microscopic. At this point we
  are probably limited by data access rather than CPU.

At this point, the performance is really fragile; small
tweaks make hard-to-understand differences. Further, setup
time and search time are looking pretty balanced. I think
it's unlikely that further tuning of the existing approach
can make this code dramatically quicker: a whole new solver
algorithm would be needed.

In terms of overheads, the remaining possibilites are ugly.

* One could cheat massively by compiling the pre-digested
  dictionaries into the program to save a millisecond or
  two, but ugh.

### Branches

The `main` branch code uses `std::fs::read_to_string()`
followed by line splitting of the string to read the
dictionaries. The branch `bufread` in this repo moves to
using `std::fs::open()` and `std::io::BufRead::lines()`. It
is dramatically slower, taking about 20ms extra just to
process the dictionaries. Rust I/O performance is a bit
wack.

The `main` branch uses a recursive solver. The branch
`nonrecursive-solvify` in this repo makes the solver
iterative using an explicit stack. It is not noticeably
faster currently, but that appears to be a function of the
already-rapid solver time.

The branch `no_std` in this repo allows building a `no_std`
version of the program. It is not faster than the `std`
version, but was sure more work to produce.

The branch `parallelized` in this repo includes both a
`rayon`-parallelized and custom scoped-thread-parallelized
version of the program. These provided less than a
millisecond of speedup, and thus were removed to simplify
the program.

The branch `retro2` in this repo includes both Python and
Rust versions of all the stages of the construction of
`wordle5`, as recreated for expository purposes.

The branches `retro2-par` and `retro2-par-fast` in this repo
contain parallelized versions of the `retro2` code with
naÃ¯ve and pruned search. The `retro2-par-fast` branch has
the fastest Python version currently, at around 120ms.

### Features

To see node counts from the solver, build with the
`instrument` feature. This will display node counts at each
search tree depth as well as a total node count to `stderr`.

To get times for initialization, solver, and output build
with the `timing` feature. This will display the wall-clock
time for each of these pieces to `stderr`.

To get end-to-end runtime in `main()`, build with the
`full-timing` feature. This will display the wall-clock time
for this piece to `stderr`.

## Word Lists

* `words-nyt-wordle.txt` (12945 words): I've taken the
  liberty of combining the NYT Wordle word lists into a
  single file and filtering duplicates. It doesn't change
  performance notably, and it's way more convenient.

* `words-alpha.txt` (15913 words): I've filtered
  `words_alpha.txt` (wherever that came from) to just
  five-letter words and removed all consonant-only words
  (all words contain at least one of *aeiouyw*).

* `words-bart.txt` (17560 words): I've built my own wordlist
  as the union of wordlists in
  [my `wordlists` repo](https://github.com/BartMassey/wordlists),
  filtered the same as `words-alpha.txt`.
