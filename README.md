# pseudoparker-wordle5
Bart Massey 2022-09-12

This is code for a demo of rewriting Python to Rust.  The
idea is to take a na√Øve Python Wordle5 solver inspired by
Matt Parker's Python solver and speed it up.

The Rust here corresponds closely to the Python. The Rust
runs in about 20 seconds. The Python runs in something over
20 minutes.
