# wordle5-retro
Bart Massey 2022-09-10

This is code for a demo of rewriting Python to Rust.  The
idea is to take a na√Øve Python Wordle5 solver inspired by
Matt Parker's Python solver, rewrite in Rust, and then
run them both forward in parallel over a series of optimizations.

The Python here runs for a very long time.
